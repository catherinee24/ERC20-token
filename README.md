<h1>ERC20 token with Solidity â›“ðŸ’°</h1>

<p>Creating a token in bsc and polygon matic, it was fun and I think it's a super good exercise to reaffirm the fundamentals and scale a bit in security, of course it's a very basic token, using SafeMath, and creating an interface to add functions to the contract .</p>
