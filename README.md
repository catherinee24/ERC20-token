<h1>ERC20 token with Solidity ⛓💰</h1>

<p>I made a token in bsc and polygon matic network, it was fun and I think it's a super good exercise to reaffirm the fundamentals and scale a bit in security, of course it's a very basic token, using SafeMath, and creating an interface to add functions to the contract .</p>


<p>You can see the smart contract on Bscscan: <a href="https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0x943c9db7618bebcb1c4fa4ceca0afa48b1c718da#code"> Token </a></p>

<p>and also you can see the smart contract on Polygonscan: <a href="https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x7386BaF3c1e841552aFcB82F73903F62eB60EfE6"> Token </a>
